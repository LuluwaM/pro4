# 🚴‍♂️ Image Classification for Scones Unlimited

📌 **Project Overview**  
This project demonstrates an image classification model built to distinguish between bicycles and motorcycles for **Scones Unlimited**, a delivery-focused logistics company. The model helps optimize operations by assigning delivery professionals to the correct orders and loading bays based on their vehicle type, improving delivery efficiency and routing. The project showcases end-to-end machine learning on AWS, including model training, deployment, and integration with serverless services for scalable, on-demand usage.  

🎯 **Objectives**  
- Detect bicycles and motorcycles for delivery routing.  
- Build a scalable and safe ML model ready for on-demand usage.  
- Integrate the model with AWS Lambda and Step Functions for automated workflows.
  

🛠️ **Tools Used**  
- **AWS Sagemaker** – Model training & deployment  
- **AWS Lambda** – Serverless functions  
- **AWS Step Functions** – Workflow orchestration  
- **Python** – Data processing & model development  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Visualization  

📋 **Project Steps**  
1. **Data Staging** – Collect and prepare images for model training.  
2. **Model Training & Deployment** – Train the image classification model and deploy it using Sagemaker.  
3. **Lambdas & Step Function Workflow** – Build supporting services and orchestrate them with Step Functions.  
4. **Testing & Evaluation** – Validate model performance with test images and metrics.
